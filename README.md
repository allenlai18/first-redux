Master Detail View -> list of books - detail of book


learned about
- upgrading components to Container (smart component)
- reducers - a reducer is a function that returns a piece of application state



Redux - webpack, redux router,react router, redux promise, redux thunk, hot reloading...


"Redux is a predictable state container" . application state


steps to use Redux
--  1. create Reducer which returns application state
2. implement mapStateToProps(state) in container
3. create action creators - which returns an action (JS object with {type: "name"})
4. implements mapDispatchToProps() in container -- it lets actions be passed to reducers
